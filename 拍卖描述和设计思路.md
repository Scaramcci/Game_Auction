### 1. INTRODUCTION

How QUICKLY IS NEW PRIVATE INFORMATION about the underlying value of a speculative commodity incorporated into market prices? How valuable is private information to an insider? How does noise trading affect the volatility of prices? What determines the liquidity of a speculative market? The purpose of this paper is to show how answers to questions like these can be obtained as derived results by modelling rigorously the trading strategy of an insider in a dynamic model of efficient price formation.

In the particular model we investigate, one risky asset is exchanged for a riskless asset among three kinds of traders: a single insider who has unique access to a private observation of the ex post liquidation value of the risky asset; uninformed noise traders who trade randomly; and market makers who set prices efficiently (in the semi-strong sense) conditional on information they have about the quantities traded by others. Trading is modelled as a sequence of many auctions, structured to give the model the flavor of a sequential equilibrium as described by Kreps and Wilson \[4].

At each auction trading takes place in two steps. In step one, the insider and the noise traders simultaneously choose the quantities they will trade (in effect, placing "market orders"). When making this choice, the insider's information consists of his private observation of the liquidation value of the asset, as well as past prices and past quantities traded by himself. He does not observe current or future prices, or current or future quantities traded by noise traders. The random quantity traded by noise traders is distributed independently from present or past quantities traded by the insider and independently from past quantities traded by noise traders. In step two, the market makers set a price, and trade the quantity which makes markets clear. When doing so, their information consists of observations of the current and past aggregate quantities traded by the insider and noise traders combined. We call these aggregate quantities the "order flow."

Market makers do not observe the individual quantities traded by the insider or noise traders separately, nor do they have any other kind of special information. As a consequence, price fluctuations are always a consequence of order flow innovations.

The informed trader, who is risk neutral, is assumed to maximize expected profits. He acts as an intertemporal monopolist in the asset market, taking into account explicitly the effect his trading at one auction has on the price at that auction and the trading opportunities available at future auctions. The prices determined by market makers are assumed to equal the expectation of the liquidation value of the commodity, conditional on the market makers' information sets at the dates the prices are determined. Thus, market makers earn on average zero profits. Since they cannot distinguish the trading of the insider from the trading of noise traders, the noise traders in effect provide camouflage which enables the insider to make profits at their expense.

By assuming that the relevant random variables are normally distributed, the model acquires a tractable linear structure. This makes it possible to characterize explicitly a unique "sequential auction equilibrium" in which prices and quantities are simple linear functions of the observations defining the relevant information sets. In the limit as the time interval between auctions goes to zero, the discrete-time equilibrium converges to a particularly simple limit which we call a "continuous auction equilibrium." This equilibrium corresponds to what one obtains when the model is set up heuristically in continuous time.

In both the discrete model and the continuous limit, answers to the questions posed at the beginning of this paper are readily obtained. The informed trader trades in such a way that his private information is incorporated into prices gradually. In the continuous auction equilibrium where the quantity traded by noise traders follows a Brownian motion process, prices also follow Brownian motion. The constant volatility reflects the fact that information is incorporated into prices at a constant rate. Furthermore, all of the insider's private information is incorporated into prices by the end of trading in a continuous auction equilibrium. An ex ante doubling of the quantities traded by noise traders induces the insider and market makers to double the quantities they trade, but has no effect on prices, and thus doubles the profits of the insider.

Perhaps the most interesting properties concern the liquidity characteristics of the market in a continuous auction equilibrium. "Market liquidity" is a slippery and elusive concept, in part because it encompasses a number of transactional properties of markets. These include "tightness" (the cost of turning around a position over a short period of time), "depth" (the size of an order flow innovation required to change prices a given amount), and "resiliency" (the speed with which prices recover from a random, uninformative shock). Black \[2] describes intuitively a liquid market in the following manner:

"The market for a stock is liquid if the following conditions hold:

(1) There are always bid and asked prices for the investor who wants to buy or sell small amounts of stock immediately.

(2) The difference between the bid and asked prices (the spread) is always small.

(3) An investor who is buying or selling a large amount of stock, in the absence of special information, can expect to do so over a long period of time at a price not very different, on average, from the current market price.

(4) An investor can buy or sell a large block of stock immediately, but at a premium or discount that depends on the size of the block. The larger the block, the larger the premium or discount.

In other words, a liquid market is a continuous market, in the sense that almost any amount of stock can be bought or sold immediately, and an efficient market, in the sense that small amounts of stock can always be bought and sold very near the current market price, and in the sense that large amounts can be bought or sold over long periods of time at prices that, on average, are very near the current market price."

Roughly speaking, Black defines a liquid market as one which is almost infinitely tight, which is not infinitely deep, and which is resilient enough so that prices eventually tend to their underlying value.

Our continuous auction equilibrium has exactly the characteristics described by Black. Furthermore, these aspects of market liquidity acquire a new prominence in our model because the insider, who does not trade as a perfect competitor, must make rational conjectures about tightness, depth, and resiliency in choosing his optimal quantity to trade. Moreover, depth and resiliency are themselves endogenous consequences of the presence of the insider and noise traders in the market. Market depth is proportional to the amount of noise trading and inversely proportional to the amount of private information (in the sense of an error variance) which has not yet been incorporated into prices. This makes our model a rigorous version of the intuitive story told by Bagehot \[1]. Furthermore, our emphasis on the dynamic optimizing behavior of the insider distinguishes our model from the one of Glosten and Milgrom \[3].

The plan of the rest of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, a single auction equilibrium is discussed in order to motivate the dynamic models which follow. In Section 3, a sequential auction equilibrium is defined, an existence and uniqueness result is proved, and properties of the equilibrium are derived. In Section 4, a continuous auction equilibrium is discussed heuristically, and in Section 5, it is shown that the continuous auction equilibrium is the limit of the sequential auction equilibrium as the time interval between auctions goes to zero. Section 6 makes some concluding comments.

### 2. A SINGLE AUCTION EQUILIBRIUM&#xA;

In this section we motivate our equilibrium concept by discussing a simple model of one-shot trading.

#### Structure and Notation&#xA;

The ex post liquidation value of the risky asset, denoted $\tilde{v}_{1}$, is normally distributed with mean $p_{0}$ and variance $\sum _{o}$. The quantity traded by noise traders, denoted $\tilde{u}$, is normally distributed with mean zero and variance $\sigma_{u}^{2}$. The random variables $\tilde{v}$ and $\tilde{u}$ are independently distributed. The quantity traded by the insider is denoted $\tilde{x}$ and the price is denoted $\tilde{p}$.

Trading is structured in two steps as follows: In step one, the exogenous values of $\tilde{v}$ and $\tilde{u}$ are realized and the insider chooses the quantity he trades $\tilde{x}$. When doing so, he observes $\tilde{v}$ but not $\tilde{u}$. To accommodate mixed strategies, the insider's trading strategy, denoted $X$, assigns to outcomes of $\tilde{v}$ probability distributions defined over quantities traded. Since, however, mixed strategies are not optimal in what follows, the more intuitive interpretation of $X$ as a measurable function such that $\tilde{x}=X(\tilde{v})$ is justified. In step two, the market makers determine the price $\tilde{p}$ at which they trade the quantity necessary to clear the market. When doing so they observe $\tilde{x}+\tilde{u}$ but not $\tilde{x}$ or $\tilde{u}$ (or $\tilde{v}$) separately. While their pricing rule, denoted $P$, can be defined to accommodate randomization, an intuitive interpretation of $P$ as a measurable real function such that $\tilde{p}=P(\tilde{x}+\tilde{u})$ is also justified.

The profits of the informed trader, denoted $\tilde{\pi}$, are given by $\tilde{\pi}=(\tilde{v}-\tilde{p}) \tilde{x}$. To emphasize the dependence of $\pi$ and $\tilde{p}$ on $X$ and $P$ we write $\tilde{\pi}=\tilde{\pi}(X, P)$, $\tilde{p}=\tilde{p}(X, P)$.

#### Definition of Equilibrium&#xA;

An equilibrium is defined as a pair $X, P$ such that the following two conditions hold:

(1) Profit Maximization: For any alternate trading strategy $X'$ and for any $v$

$
(2.1) E\{\tilde{\pi}(X, P) | \tilde{v}=v\} \geq E\left\{\tilde{\pi}\left(X', P\right) | \tilde{v}=v\right\}.
 $

(2) Market Efficiency: The random variable $\tilde{p}$ satisfies

$
(2.2) \tilde{p}(X, P)=E\{\tilde{v} | \tilde{x}+\tilde{u}\}.
 $

This model is not quite a game theoretic one because the market makers do not explicitly maximize any particular objective. We could, however, replace the market efficiency condition in step two with an explicit Bertrand auction between at least two risk neutral bidders, each of whom observes the "order flow" $\tilde{x}+\tilde{u}$ and nothing else. The result of this explicit auction procedure would be our market efficiency condition, in which profits of market makers are driven to zero. Modelling how market makers can earn the positive frictional profits necessary to attract them into the business of market making is an interesting topic which takes us away from our main objective of studying how price formation is influenced by the optimizing behavior of an insider in a somewhat idealized setting. Kyle \[5], however, discusses a model of imperfect competition among market makers, in which many insiders with different information participate.

The insider exploits his monopoly power by taking into account the effect the quantity he chooses to trade in step one is expected to have on the price established in step two. In doing so, he takes the rule market makers use to set prices in step two as given. He is not allowed to influence this rule by committing to a particular strategy in step one: The quantity he trades is required to be optimal, given his information set at the time it is chosen. This requirement seems to be reasonable given anonymous trading and the strong incentives informed traders have to cheat given any other strategy they commit to. The insider is not allowed to condition the quantity he trades on price. A model in which insiders choose demand functions ("limit orders") instead of quantities ("market orders") is considered in Kyle \[6].

Fortuitously, our model has an analytically tractable equilibrium in which the rules $x$ and $P$ are simple linear functions, as we show in the following theorem:

**THEOREM 1**: There exists a unique equilibrium in which $X$ and $P$ are linear functions. Defining constants $\beta$ and $\lambda$ by $\beta=(\sigma_{u}^{2} / \sum _{0})^{1 / 2}$ and $\lambda=2(\sigma_{u}^{2} / \sum _{0})^{-1 / 2}$, the equilibrium $P$ and $X$ are given by

$
(2.3) X(\tilde{v})=\beta\left(\tilde{v}-p_{0}\right), P(\tilde{x}+\tilde{u})=p_{0}+\lambda(\tilde{x}+\tilde{u}).
 $

**Proof**: Suppose that for constants $\mu$, $\lambda$, $\alpha$, $\beta$, linear functions $P$ and $X$ are given by

$
(2.4) P(y)=\mu+\lambda y, X(v)=\alpha+\beta v.
 $

Given the linear rule $P$ profits can be written

$
(2.5) E\{[\tilde{v}-P(x+\tilde{u})] x | \tilde{v}=v\}=(v-\mu-\lambda x) x.
 $

Profit maximization of this quadratic objective requires that $x$ solve $v-\mu-2 \lambda x=0$. We thus have $X(v)=\alpha+\beta v$ with

$
(2.6) 1 / \beta=2 \lambda, \alpha=-\mu \beta.
 $

Note that the quadratic objective (implied by the linear pricing rule $P$) rules out mixed strategies and also makes linear strategies optimal even when nonlinear strategies are allowed.

Given linear $X$ and $P$ the market efficiency condition is equivalent to

$
(2.7) \mu+\lambda y=E\{\tilde{v} | \alpha+\beta \tilde{v}+\tilde{u}=y\}.
 $

Normality makes the regression linear and application of the projection theorem yields

$
(2.8) \lambda=\frac{\beta \sum_{0}}{\beta^{2} \sum_{0}+\sigma_{u}^{2}}, \mu-p_{0}=-\lambda\left(\alpha+\beta p_{0}\right).
 $

Solving (2.6) and (2.8) subject to the second order condition $\lambda>0$ yields the desired result. Note that we have $\mu=p_{0}$, $\alpha=-\beta p_{0}$, and the second order condition rules out a solution with $\beta$ and $\lambda$ both negative. This completes the proof of the theorem.

#### Properties of the Equilibrium&#xA;

The equilibrium $X$ and $P$ are determined by the exogenous parameters $o$ and $\sigma_{u}^{2}$. To obtain a measure of the informativeness of prices, define $\sum _{1}$ by $\sum _{1}=var{\tilde{v} | \tilde{p}}$. A simple calculation shows that $\sum _{1}=\frac{1}{2} \sum _{0}$; thus, one-half of the insider's private information is incorporated into prices and the volatility of prices is unaffected by the level of noise trading $\sigma_{u}^{2}$.

The quantity $1 / \lambda$ measures the "depth" of the market, i.e. the order flow necessary to induce prices to rise or fall by one dollar. This measure of market liquidity is proportional to a ratio of the amount of noise trading to the amount of private information the informed trader is expected to have. In this sense, it captures Bagehot's \[1] intuition that market makers compensate themselves for bad trades due to the adverse selection of insiders by making the market less liquid. Maximized profits, given by $v^{2} /(4 \lambda)$, are proportional to the depth of the market, because a proportional horizontal expansion of the supply curve induces the monopsonistic insider to trade a proportionately larger quantity without affecting prices, and this makes his profits correspondingly larger as well. Since an increase in noise trading brings forth more informed trading, it does not destabilize prices (a result which would disappear if the insider were risk averse). The expected profits of the insider (unconditional on $\tilde{v}$) are given by $E(\tilde{\pi})=$ $\frac{1}{2}(\sum _{0} \sigma_{u}^{2})^{1 / 2}$: The insider's profits are proportional to the standard deviations of both $\tilde{v}$ and $\tilde{u}$.

As shown below, many of these properties generalize to the sequential auction model in an appropriate way.

### 3. A SEQUENTIAL AUCTION EQUILIBRIUM&#xA;

In this section we generalize the model of one-shot trading by examining a model in which a number of auctions, or rounds of trading, take place sequentially. The resulting dynamic model is structured so that equilibrium prices at each auction reflect the information contained in the past and current order flow and so that the insider maximizes his expected profits, taking into account his effect on prices in both the current auction and in future auctions.

#### Structure and Notation&#xA;

Trading takes place over one trading day, which begins at time $t=0$ and ends at time $t=1$. There are $N$ auctions, with $t_{n}$ denoting the time at which the $n$th auction takes place. We assume

$
(3.1) 0=t_{0}<t_{1}<\cdots<t_{N}=1,
 $

so the sequence of auction dates $< t_{n}>$ partitions the interval $[0,1]$.

Let $\tilde{u}(t)$ denote a Brownian motion process with instantaneous variance $\sigma_{u}^{2}$, and define $\tilde{u}_{n}$ and $\Delta \tilde{u}_{n}$ by $\tilde{u}_{n}=\tilde{u}(t_{n})$ and $\Delta \tilde{u}_{n}=\tilde{u}_{n}-\tilde{u}_{n-1}$. We assume that the quantity traded by noise traders at the $n$th auction is $\Delta \tilde{u}_{n}$. The Brownian motion assumption implies that $\Delta \tilde{u}_{n}$ is normally distributed with zero mean and variance $\sigma_{u}^{2} \Delta t_{n}$, where $\Delta t_{n}=t_{n}-t_{n-1}$, and that the quantity traded at one auction is independent of the quantity traded at other auctions. The liquidation value of the asset, $\tilde{v}$, is still assumed to be normally distributed with mean $p_{0}$ and variance $\sum _{o}$. The random variable $\tilde{v}$ is distributed independently of the entire process $\tilde{u}(t)$.

The $N$ auctions take place sequentially. Let $\tilde{x}_{n}$ denote the aggregate position of the insider after the $n$th auction, so that $\Delta \tilde{x}_{n}$ (defined by $\Delta \tilde{x}_{n}=\tilde{x}_{n}-\tilde{x}_{n-1}$) denotes the quantity traded by the insider at the $n$th auction. Let $\tilde{p}_{n}$ denote the market clearing price at the $n$th auction. At each auction, trade is structured in two steps as before, with information sets modified to take into account relevant information from past auctions. Since mixed trading strategies and random pricing rules are not optimal in what follows, we are justified in interpreting the trading rules and pricing rules as functions of the relevant observations. According to this interpretation, when the insider chooses the quantity to trade at step one of an auction, he not only observes the liquidation value of the asset, $\tilde{v}_{1}$ but also past prices as well. Accordingly, for some measurable function $X_{n}$, his position after the $n$th auction is given by

$
(3.2) \tilde{x}_{n}=X_{n}\left(\tilde{p}_{1}, ... \tilde{p}_{n-1}, \tilde{v}\right) \quad(n=1, ..., N),
 $

from which the actual quantity traded is easily determined using information in the information set. When market makers set a market clearing price at step two of the $n$th auction, they not only observe the current value of the order flow, $\Delta \tilde{x}_{n}+\Delta \tilde{u}_{n}$, but they observe past values of the order flow as well. Accordingly, for some measurable function $P_{n}$, the price $\tilde{p}_{n}$ is determined by

$
(3.3) \tilde{p}_{n}=P_{n}\left(\tilde{x}_{1}+\tilde{u}_{1}, ..., \tilde{x}_{n}+\tilde{u}_{n}\right) \quad(n=1, ..., N).
 $

Note that in the absence of mixed strategies, the insider can infer from his information set the quantities he has traded at past auctions, and the market makers can infer from their information set the prices they have set in the past. Note also that the insider can infer the quantities traded by noise traders in the past if the functions $P_{n}$ are monotonic in their last arguments.

Now define the vectors of functions $X$ and $P$ by

$
(3.4) X=\left< X_{1}, ..., X_{N}\right>, P=\left< P_{1}, ..., P_{N}\right>.
 $

We refer to $X$ as the informed trader's "trading strategy" and to $P$ as the market makers'"pricing rule."

For $n=1, ..., N$ let $\tilde{\pi}_{n}$ denote the profits of the insider on positions acquired at auctions $n, ..., N$. Clearly, $\tilde{\pi}_{n}$ is given by

$
(3.5) \tilde{\pi}_{n}=\sum_{k=n}^{N}\left(\tilde{v}-\tilde{p}_{k}\right) \tilde{x}_{k} \quad(n=1, ..., N).
 $

To emphasize the dependence of $\tilde{p}_{n}$, $\tilde{x}_{n}$ and $\tilde{\pi}_{n}$ on $P$ and $X$ we sometimes write

$
(3.6) \tilde{p}_{n}=\tilde{p}_{n}(X, P), \tilde{x}_{n}=\tilde{x}_{n}(X, P), \tilde{\pi}_{n}=\tilde{\pi}_{n}(X, P).
 $

#### Equilibrium&#xA;

A sequential auction equilibrium is defined as a pair $X, P$ such that the following two conditions hold:

1. Profit Maximization: For all $n=1, ..., N$ and for all $X'=< X_{1}', ..., X_{N}'>$ such that $X_{1}'=X_{1}, ..., X_{n-1}'=X_{n-1}$, we have

$
(3.7) E\left\{\tilde{\pi}_{n}(X, P) | \tilde{p}_{1}, ..., \tilde{p}_{n-1}, \tilde{v}\right\} \geq E\left\{\tilde{\pi}_{n}\left(X', P\right) | \tilde{p}_{1}, ..., \tilde{p}_{n-1}, \tilde{v}\right\}.
 $

1. Market Efficiency: For all $n=1, ..., N$ we have

$
(3.8) \tilde{p}_{n}=E\left\{\tilde{v} | \tilde{x}_{1}+\tilde{u}_{1}, ..., \tilde{x}_{n}+\tilde{u}_{n}\right\}.
 $

A linear equilibrium is defined as a (sequential auction) equilibrium in which the component functions of $X$ and $P$ are linear, and a recursive linear equilibrium is defined as a linear equilibrium in which there exist constants $\lambda_{1}, ..., \lambda_{N}$ such that for $n=1, ..., N$

$
(3.9) \tilde{p}_{n}=\tilde{p}_{n-1}+\lambda_{n}\left(\Delta \tilde{x}_{n}+\Delta \tilde{u}_{n}\right).
 $

The market efficiency condition implies that trading prices follow a martingale whose pattern of volatility over time reflects the rate at which information is incorporated into prices. In a linear equilibrium, price increments are normally and independently distributed with zero means; thus, the distribution function for the pricing process is characterized by a sequence of variance parameters measuring the volatility of price fluctuations from auction to auction.

The profit maximization condition gives our equilibrium the flavor of a sequential equilibrium (as discussed by Kreps and Wilson \[4]). The quantity $\bar{x}_{n}$ chosen at the $n$th auction maximizes expected profits over the remaining rounds of trading given the information available to the insider when he chooses it. There is no commitment to strategies. This means that the insider cannot influence the pricing rule by committing to a trading rule before prices are established. Conversely, while the market makers impute a trading strategy to the insider, they do not observe it; they only observe the order flow. Note, however, that the profit maximization condition implies that for all trading strategies $X'$,

$
(3.10) E\left\{\tilde{\pi}_{n}(X, P)\right\} \geq E\left\{\tilde{\pi}_{n}\left(X', P\right)\right\}.
 $

#### Characterization of Equilibrium&#xA;

In the rest of this section, we prove existence of a unique linear equilibrium, show that it is a recursive linear equilibrium, and characterize it as the solution to a difference equation system subject to boundary conditions. We suspect, but have not been able to prove, that equilibria with nonlinear $X_{n}$ and $P_{n}$ do not exist.

**THEOREM 2**: There exists a unique linear equilibrium and this equilibrium is a recursive linear equilibrium. In this equilibrium there are constants $\beta_{n}$, $\lambda_{n}$, $\alpha_{n}$, $\delta_{n}$, and $\sum _{n}$ such that for

$
(3.11) \Delta \tilde{x}_{n}=\beta_{n}\left(\tilde{v}-\tilde{p}_{n-1}\right) \Delta t_{n},
 $

$
(3.12) \Delta \tilde{p}_{n}=\lambda_{n}\left(\Delta \tilde{x}_{n}+\Delta \tilde{u}_{n}\right),
 $

$
(3.13) \sum_{n}=var\left(\tilde{v} | \Delta \tilde{x}_{1}+\Delta \tilde{u}_{1}, ..., \Delta \tilde{x}_{n}+\Delta \tilde{u}_{n}\right),
 $

$
(3.14) E\left\{\tilde{\pi}_{n} | p_{1}, ..., p_{n-1}, v\right\}=\alpha_{n-1}\left(v-p_{n-1}\right)^{2}+\delta_{n-1} \quad(n=1, ..., N).
 $

Given $\sum _{0}$, the constants $\beta_{n}$, $\lambda_{n}$, $\alpha_{n}$, $\delta_{n}$, $\sum _{n}$ are the unique solution to the difference equation system

$
(3.15) \alpha_{n-1}=\frac{1}{4 \lambda_{n}\left(1-\alpha_{n} \lambda_{n}\right)},
 $

$
(3.16) \delta_{n-1}=\delta_{n}+\alpha_{n} \lambda_{n}^{2} \sigma_{u}^{2} \Delta t_{n},
 $

$
(3.17) \beta_{n} \Delta t_{n}=\frac{1-2 \alpha_{n} \lambda_{n}}{2 \lambda_{n}\left(1-\alpha_{n} \lambda_{n}\right)},
 $

$
(3.18) \lambda_{n}=\beta_{n} \sum_{n} / \sigma_{u}^{2},
 $

$
(3.19) \sum_{n}=\left(1-\beta_{n} \lambda_{n} \Delta t_{n}\right) \sum_{n-1} \quad(n=1, ..., N),
 $

subject to $\alpha_{N}=\delta_{N}=0$ and the second order condition

$
(3.20) \lambda_{n}\left(1-\alpha_{n} \lambda_{n}\right)>0.
 $

**REMARK**: The parameters $\beta_{n}(n=1, ..., N)$, which characterize the insider's trading strategy $X_{n}$, measure the intensity with which the insider trades on the basis of his private observation, and the parameters $\lambda_{n}(n=1, ..., N)$, which characterize the recursive pricing rule, measure the depth of the market (with small $\lambda_{n}$ corresponding to a deep market). The parameters $\sum _{n}(n=1, ..., N)$, which give the error variance of prices after the $n$th auction, measure how much of the insider's private information is not yet incorporated into prices (as estimated by market makers). Note that $\sum _{0}$ is just the variance of the initial prior price $p_{0}$. The parameters $\alpha_{n-1}$ and $\delta_{n-1}$ define a quadratic profit function which gives the value of trading opportunities at auctions $n, ..., N$.

#### Outline of Proof&#xA;

The proof of the theorem is divided into three steps. In the first step, which is the most important one, a backward induction argument is used to obtain the insider's trading strategy and expected trading profits as a function of the pricing rule. Since the pricing rule is characterized by the market depth parameters $\lambda_{n}$, the insider's problem is intuitively one of deciding how intensely to trade on the basis of his private information, given the pattern of market depth expected at current and future auctions. If market depth at future auctions is greater than market depth at the current auction, the insider has an incentive to "save" his private information by trading small quantities now and large quantities later. Conversely, if market depth declines in future auctions, the insider has an incentive to trade intensely at the current auction, where profits are greater.

Intuitively, the second order condition (3.20) rules out a situation in which the insider can make unbounded profits by first destabilizing prices with unprofitable trades made at the $n$th auction, then recouping the losses and much more with profitable trades made at future auctions. When $\lambda_{n}$ is large, it does not cost much to destabilize prices at the $n$th auction (because trading small quantities is sufficient), but when $\alpha_{n}$ is large, the value of future trading opportunities to the insider from moving the price far away from its liquidation value is large. The second order condition accordingly rules out unbounded destabilization schemes by placing an upper bound on $\lambda_{n}$ which decreases in $\alpha_{n}$.

The backward induction argument in step one of the proof simultaneously shows that the insider's profit function is quadratic and that the linear equilibrium is recursive. In addition, it shows explicitly how the parameter $\alpha_{n}$, which measures the value of private information at future auctions $n+1, ..., N$ as a function of market depth at those auctions, combines with the current market depth parameter $\lambda_{n}$ to generate via backward induction values of $\beta_{n}$ and $\alpha_{n-1}$.

In step two of the proof, the market efficiency condition is used to derive $\lambda_{n}$ and $\sum _{n}$ from $\beta_{n}$ and $\sum _{n-1}$. The idea here is that, given the level of noise trading $(\sigma_{u}^{2} \Delta t_{n})$, the depth of the market at a particular auction $(\lambda_{n})$ depends negatively upon how much private information the insider has $(\sum _{n-1})$ and how intensely the insider trades upon the basis of his private information $(\beta_{n})$ and this also determines how much of the insider's remaining private information is revealed at the particular auction and how much still remains private $(\sum _{n})$. This step of the proof makes precise Bagehot's idea that market makers respond to insider trading by reducing the liquidity of the market.

In step three of the proof, it is shown that the relationships derived in the first two steps generate a difference equation system which characterizes the unique linear equilibrium.

## **2 离散拍卖的线性均衡假设**

论文先在 **离散时点**$ t_k=k\Delta t,\;k=1,\dots,n$ 上假设价格线性：

$P_k=\mu+\lambda_k Q_k,\qquad Q_k:=\sum_{j=1}^{k}q_j $,

其中 $q_k=x_k+u_k $为当期**净**订单，$x_k $为内幕者提交的数量，$u_k\sim\mathcal N(0,\sigma_u^2)$。

若内幕者也采取**线性策略**

$x_k=\beta_k\,(v-\mu)-\phi_k\,Q_{k-1}$,

则可用向后归纳求得系数序列 $\{\lambda_k,\beta_k,\phi_k\}$。关键结果（对称线性均衡）是

$\lambda_k=\frac{\sigma_v}{\sigma_u}\,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2(n-k)+1}},\qquad \beta_k=\frac{\sigma_v}{\sigma_u}\,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2(n-k)+1}}$.

---

## **3 连续时间极限：Δt → 0**

令$ \Delta t =T/n$，当$ n\to\infty $得到连续时间表达：

### **3.1 价格冲击（冲击弹性）**

$\boxed{\;\lambda_t=\frac{\sigma_v}{\sigma_u\sqrt{T-t}}\;},\qquad 0\le t<T$.

价格对**瞬时**净订单流的敏感度随剩余时间减少而递增，临到终点冲击趋于无穷大，保证$ P_T=v$。

### **3.2 内幕最佳交易速率**

$\boxed{\;\theta_t=\lambda_t\,(v-P_t)=\frac{\sigma_v}{\sigma_u\sqrt{T-t}}\,(v-P_t)\;}$.

直观解释：

- $(v-P_t) $是“剩余信息优势”；
- $\displaystyle 1/\sqrt{T-t}$ 体现“**泄露压力**”：时间愈少，需更快平仓。

### **3.3 订单流与价格演化**

$\begin{aligned} dY_t &= \theta_t\,dt + \sigma_u\,dW_t,\\ dP_t &= \lambda_t\,dY_t = \lambda_t\theta_t\,dt+\lambda_t\sigma_u\,dW_t = \bigl(\tfrac{\sigma_v}{\sigma_u\sqrt{T-t}}\bigr)^2\!(v-P_t)\,dt +\tfrac{\sigma_v}{\sqrt{T-t}}\,dW_t. \end{aligned}$

- **漂移项**逐步把价格推向 v；
- **噪声项**体现流动性交易造成的短期价格随机性。

## **4 均衡性质**

1. **价格发现速度**

   均衡误差方差呈线性衰减：

   $\mathbb E[(v-P_t)^2]=\sigma_v^2\bigl(1-\tfrac{t}{T}\bigr)$.

   即价格在整段时间内均匀吸收信息。
2. **内幕累计期望利润**

   $\Pi=\mathbb E\!\left[\int_0^T\theta_t\,(v-P_t)\,dt\right] =\frac{\sigma_v\sigma_u}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sqrt{T}$.
3. **市商零期望利润**

   因定价采取条件期望，市商在任何$ [0,t]$ 区间的盈亏期望均为零。

# 实验设计参考思路

## **1 状态初始化**

给定起始预算 $\bar{b}>0$，所有竞买人

$b_i^{(1)}=\bar{b},\qquad q_i^{(1)}=0,\qquad i=1,\dots,N .$

若采用 i.i.d. 价值模型，\{v_i^{(t)}\} 在每回合独立抽样

$v_i^{(t)}\sim F,\;t=1,\dots,T$ .

内幕交易者能够在出价前观察本轮的 $v_{\text{insider}}^{(t)}$，其余智能体只知道分布 F。

## **2 可行动作集合**

预算约束使得

$\mathcal{A}_i^{(t)}=\bigl\{\,a\in\mathcal{B}\;:\;a\le b_i^{(t)}\bigr\}$.

若$ b_i^{(t)}<0 $则退出；若 $b_i^{(t)}<\min\mathcal{B}$ 则只能出价 0。

## **3 出价阶段**

所有竞买人**同时**提交出价

$a_i^{(t)}\in\mathcal{A}_i^{(t)},\qquad i=1,\dots,N$.

## **4 决胜与支付机制**

1. **确定胜者**

   $w_t=\arg\max_{i} a_i^{(t)}$.

   若出现并列，用等概率随机选取一位胜者。
2. **成交价**（第一价格拍卖）

   $p_t=a_{w_t}^{(t)}$.
3. **即时效用**

   $u_i^{(t)}= \begin{cases} v_i^{(t)}-p_t, & i=w_t,\\[4pt] 0, & i\ne w_t. \end{cases}$

## **5 状态转移**

- **预算更新**

  $b_i^{(t+1)} = \begin{cases} b_i^{(t)}-p_t, & i=w_t,\\ b_i^{(t)}, & i\ne w_t. \end{cases}$
- **持仓更新**

  $q_i^{(t+1)} = \begin{cases} q_i^{(t)}+1, & i=w_t,\\ q_i^{(t)}, & i\ne w_t. \end{cases}$
- **回合终止**：若 $t=T$ 或$ \forall i,\;b_i^{(t+1)}<\min\mathcal{B}$。

## **6 长期目标**

每个学习型 Agent（市商、内幕者）最大化折扣累计收益

$\max_{\pi_i}\; \mathbb{E}\Bigl[\sum_{t=1}^{T}\gamma^{t-1}\,u_i^{(t)}\Bigr]$,

其中策略$ \pi_i $把观测$ o_i^{(t)}=(b_i^{(t)},q_i^{(t)},\text{历史},\;v_i^{(t)}{\rm\ 或\ 0}) $映射到概率分布 $\Pr\{a_i^{(t)}=\cdot\}$。

噪音交易者采取固定随机策略 $\pi_{\text{noise}}$。

## **7 拍卖收益与效率指标**

- **拍卖人期望收入**

  $\mathrm{Rev}=\mathbb{E}\bigl[p_t\bigr] =\mathbb{E}\bigl[\max_i a_i^{(t)}\bigr]$.
- **社会福利**（真值减支付之和）

  $\mathrm{SW}=\mathbb{E}\!\Bigl[\sum_{i=1}^{N}u_i^{(t)}\Bigr]$.
- **均衡出价函数**（若价值连续且无预算约束，经典结果给出

  $\beta(v)=\dfrac{N-1}{N}v$。

  在离散与预算有限场景，$\beta $可用近似动态规划或 RL 逼近。）

---

### **过程小结**

1. **信息流**：抽取价值 → 内幕者获私有信号 → 全体同时报离散出价。
2. **规则**：最高出价者赢得物品并按第一价格支付；预算-库存即时更新。
3. **学习**：市商与内幕者通过 RL 更新策略，在离散网格 $\mathcal{B} $上学习最优或次优出价；噪音者保持固定随机行为，提供市场扰动。

上述公式完全描述了 **离散-第一价格密封拍卖** 的状态、动作、奖励和转移机制，后续实现环境或推导均可据此展开。
